	aboutText:
		"I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the CBT Center for Anxiety and OCD in PA as well as Behavioral Associates in New York City. I am specializing in the treatment of anxiety related disorders such as, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Perfectionism, Body Dysmorphia etc.\n\nI love being a psychologist. I find my clinical work to be extremely rewarding both professionally and personally. In this role, I am able to meet people from all walks of lives and get a deep perspective on what it is like to be them. I am grateful that my work allows me to have a real connection with people and contribute to their lives in very meaningful ways. \n\nI grew up in India and moved to the US for my undergraduate studies. The time that I have spent in both places has allowed me to develop and embrace a unique sense of identity. My values, principles, ethics, dreams are an amalgamation of both these beautiful cultures. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy learning new things, traveling, eating and cooking new foods, watching movies, taking nature walks and spending time with the kids in my life. My other interests include understanding the nature of consciousness, Buddhism, spirituality and philosophy.",

		"My goal in therapy is to help provide the best possible psychological care for my patients by using a holistic and person-centered approach that involves understanding the human behind the illness.\n\nI have extensive experience using a variety of Evidence-Based Treatments (EBTs), such as, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Behavior Therapy (BT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and have used these approaches to help individuals of all ages with complex psychological presentations including mood disorders, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, personality disorders, chronic pain and substance use problems.\n\nBeing an immigrant woman of color, I am particularly interested in working with individuals from marginalized communities and those with intersectional identities. I hope that through our work together, you are able to have a better quality of life and come closer to embodying your best and most authentic self.",
