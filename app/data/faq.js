	{
		q: "Will my insurance cover therapy?",
		a: 'Your insurance policy might cover your sessions at "out-of-network" rates, potentially covering some or all of your session costs. You may need to meet deductibles, make co-payments or co-insurance payments, and be aware of any limits on the number of sessions covered, all of which could influence your out-of-pocket expenses. It is advisable to check with your insurance provider to confirm your out-of-network benefits before starting treatment. After each therapy session, we can provide you with a Superbill, which you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.',
	},
	{
		q: "Why don’t you accept insurance directly?",
		a: "We understand that working with a therapist who isn't in-network with your insurance can be financially challenging, and it can be a dealbreaker for many people. To help, we offer some reduced-rate slots. There are also several advantages to not using insurance: \n\n1. Privacy: Using insurance means agreeing to share certain treatment details, such as diagnoses and treatment dates, with the insurance company.\n\n2. Quality of Care: To provide the highest quality of care, we prefer not to have insurance companies influence the treatment plan or create administrative hurdles. This allows us to focus on your care and offer flexible payment options to support clients from various socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n3. Treatment Flexibility: Insurance companies often place limits on the type and duration of treatment, which can negatively impact the effectiveness of therapy. For example, intensive treatments that involve multiple sessions per week or longer session durations, as well as treatments conducted outside of the office (e.g., at home, work, or public places), are often not covered by insurance. By not contracting with insurance companies, we can make treatment decisions based solely on your best interests, enhancing the likelihood of achieving your treatment goals more effectively and promptly.",
