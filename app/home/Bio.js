			<p>
				I am currently the founder and owner at CALM Center for Anxiety and Life
				Managment and a licesned clinical psychologist at the CBT Center for
				Anxiety and OCD in Pennsylvania. I specialize in the treatment of
				anxiety related disorders such as, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social
				Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Perfectionism, Body
				Dysmorphia etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love being a psychologist. I find my clinical work to be extremely
				rewarding both professionally and personally. In this role, I am able to
				meet people from all walks of lives and get a deep perspective on what
				it is like to be them. I am grateful that my work allows me to have a
				real connection with people and contribute to their lives in very
				meaningful ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				I grew up in India and moved to the US for my undergraduate studies. The
				time that I have spent in both places has allowed me to develop and
				embrace a unique sense of identity. My values, principles, ethics,
				dreams are an amalgamation of both these beautiful cultures. {"\n\n"}In
				my free time, I enjoy learning new things, traveling, eating and cooking
				new foods, watching movies, taking nature walks and spending time with
				the kids in my life. My other interests include understanding the nature
				of consciousness, Buddhism, spirituality and philosophy.
