					<h2>Investment</h2>
					<p>
						Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy involves both medical and
						therapeutic services. Below is a breakdown to help you understand
						the financial commitment and plan ahead.

				<div className="medical-costs">
					<h3>Medical Costs (via Journey Clinical)</h3>
					<p>
						Journey Clinical is a separate medical provider that handles all
						evaluations and prescriptions related to ketamine.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Initial medical consultation: $250</li>
						<li>Ketamine lozenges (starter dose for 2 sessions): $97</li>
						<li>
							Follow-up medical evaluations: $150 (required at least once per
							quarter)
						</li>
						<li>Prescription refills (up to 6 doses): $163</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Some of Journey Clinical{"'"}s services may be covered by insurance
						depending on your state and provider. You can check your benefits
						here or read more about coverage.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="therapy-costs">
					<h3>Therapy Costs (Our Practice)</h3>
					<p>
						All therapy sessions are billed directly through our practice. Some
						sessions may be reimbursable through out-of-network benefits; we
						provide superbills to support that process.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Foundational therapy sessions (6 minimum): $250 per session</li>
						<li>
							Dosing sessions (8 total):
							<ul>
								<li>First hour: $330</li>
								<li>Additional time: Flat rate of $165</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Integration sessions (8 total): $250 per session</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Most dosing sessions last 90 to 120 minutes. The structure above
						helps you maximize insurance reimbursement while keeping overall
						costs more predictable.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="investment-summary">
					<h3>
						Estimated Total Cost: $7,460{" "}
						<span className="muted">
							(spread over approximately six months)
						</span>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Clients pay for each session individually after it takes place.
						There
						{"'"}s no upfront payment required.
					</p>
					<p>
						We recognize that this is a significant financial investment. That
						{"'"}s one of the reasons we use a flat-rate model for dosing
						support and provide insurance-ready documentation for reimbursable
						sessions. We{"'"}re also actively working on building a payment plan
						option to make the process more accessible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Clients who have completed this process often tell us that it was a
						meaningful, transformative investment in their healing.
