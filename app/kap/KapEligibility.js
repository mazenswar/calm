				<h2>Is KAP Right for You?</h2>
				<p>
					Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) may offer a helpful option when
					you{"'"}re feeling stuck or haven{"'"}t found relief through
					traditional methods. It{"'"}s most useful for individuals who are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Addressing anxiety, OCD, or depression that hasn{"'"}t responded to
						other treatments
					</li>
					<li>Feeling stuck in long-standing emotional patterns</li>
					<li>
						Open to exploring altered states as a pathway to deeper
						self-awareness
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We{"'"}ll work together to carefully assess whether KAP offers
					meaningful support for you. Our priority is making sure you{"'"}re
					ready, supported, and positioned to benefit safely within a
					therapeutic framework.
				</p>
