					<h2>Our KAP Process</h2>
					<p className="subhead">What to expect from start to finish</p>
					<p>
						The full KAP process typically takes place over the course of
						approximately six months, depending on your pace and schedule.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you{"'"}re considering Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) with
						us, here{"'"}s how the process typically unfolds:
					</p>
				</div>

				<ol className="kap-steps">
					<li className="step-group">
						<h3>Foundational Therapy Sessions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Minimum of 6 sessions (more if needed to establish safety and
								readiness)
							</li>
							<li>Opportunity to strengthen the therapeutic relationship</li>
							<li>
								Space to build coping skills and deepen self-awareness before
								KAP
							</li>
							<li>
								Preparation for ketamine work, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Clarifying intentions, hopes, and goals</li>
									<li>Exploring concerns, expectations, and safety planning</li>
									<li>Establishing grounding and coping tools</li>
									<li>Understanding the dosing process and set/setting</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							After your third session, if KAP appears clinically appropriate,
							we
							{"'"}ll refer you to our medical partner, Journey Clinical, for a
							comprehensive evaluation.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li className="step-group">
						<h3>Medical Screening</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Virtual consultation to review your medical and psychiatric
								history
							</li>
							<li>
								If approved, ketamine lozenges are prescribed and shipped to
								your home
							</li>
							<li>
								Ongoing contact with Journey Clinical to adjust dosing or care
								as needed
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li className="step-group">
						<h3> Dosing Sessions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Sessions are approximately 2 hours long</li>
							<li>
								You{"'"}ll be in a quiet, comfortable setting (with optional
								music or eye mask)
							</li>
							<li>
								Your therapist will be present throughout to provide support and
								ensure safety
							</li>
							<li>
								A trusted support person must be present in your home, available
								if needed
							</li>
							<li>
								In some cases, up to two in-home dosing sessions may be offered
								at the beginning of your KAP journey, discussed on a
								case-by-case basis
							</li>
							<li>
								The first two dosing sessions are exploratory to find your
								optimal dose
							</li>
							<li>
								After this, you{"'"}ll meet again with Journey Clinical to
								confirm the dosage and receive your remaining prescription
							</li>
							<li>
								Clients typically complete eight dosing sessions in total,
								scheduled over several weeks
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li className="step-group">
						<h3>Integration Sessions</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								Integration is a vital part of the healing process. This is
								where insights become lasting change.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									After each dosing session, we meet for at least one 45-minute
									integration session
								</li>
								<li>
									Typically scheduled within 24 to 72 hours when neuroplasticity
									is at its peak
								</li>
								<li>Make sense of emotional, somatic, or visual material</li>
								<li>Reflect on themes or breakthroughs that arise</li>
								<li>Connect the experience to your ongoing healing process</li>
								<li>
									Use tools like mindfulness, somatic practices, or creative
									reflection to deepen integration
								</li>
								<li>
									You{"'"}ll complete eight integration sessions, one after each
									dosing session
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li className="step-group">
						<h3> Follow-Up and Long-Term Care</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								After completing your full KAP series, continued support is
								encouraged through therapy or booster dosing sessions every 6 to
								8 weeks, if appropriate
							</li>
							<li>
								Many clients find benefit in occasional dosing sessions for
								maintenance or deepening work
							</li>
							<li>
								Continued care with your therapist and prescriber ensures
								ongoing alignment and safety
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
