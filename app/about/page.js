							<p>
								I offer integrative therapy for adults navigating anxiety,
								burnout, spiritual confusion, perfectionism, or depression. If
								you
								{"'"}re feeling stuck, disconnected, or unsure how to move
								forward, therapy can help you return to what{"'"}s most
								essential. I work with clients across New Jersey, New York, and
								Pennsylvania through online therapy that is both accessible and
								deeply personal.

							<h3>An Integrative Approach to Therapy</h3>
							<p>
								What I offer is a grounded, integrative approach to therapy that
								brings together the rigor of evidence-based Western psychology
								with the wisdom of Eastern traditions like Buddhism, Taoism, and
								Hinduism. I don{"'"}t promise spiritual experiences. But I do
								know the power of turning toward your inner world with honesty,
								humility, and courage.

							<h3>Rooted in Science and Experience</h3>
							<p>
								I hold a PhD in Clinical Psychology and have trained at

								Columbia University, Bellevue Hospital Center, and Montclair
								State University. I also have a background in psychological
								research, which continues to inform my work. In addition, I am a
								certified Reiki Master Teacher, and I draw from both scientific
								and energetic perspectives to support each client
								{"'"}s healing process when it{"'"}s welcomed and appropriate.

								for clients who are struggling with treatment-resistant anxiety,

								and create openings for deep emotional healing. My approach to
								KAP emphasizes psychological safety, therapeutic depth, and
								long-term transformation, not just temporary relief.

								My style blends practical tools with intuitive insight. Some

								unknown. I see therapy as a sacred container where real healing
								can unfold, not through quick fixes, but through presence,
								curiosity, and trust in the process.
