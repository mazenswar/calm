				<h1>Tanya Singh, PhD</h1>
				<h2>
					Therapist specialising in treating anxiety and related disorders in
					New York and Pennsylvania
				</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently the found and owner at Integrative Mental health and
					licesned Therapist at the CBT Center for Anxiety and OCD in PA. I am
					specializing in the treatment of anxiety related disorders such as,
					Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive
					Compulsive Disorder, Perfectionism, Body Dysmorphia etc.\n\nI love
					being a psychologist. I find my clinical work to be extremely
					rewarding both professionally and personally. In this role, I am able
					to meet people from all walks of lives and get a deep perspective on
					what it is like to be them. I am grateful that my work allows me to
					have a real connection with people and contribute to their lives in
					very meaningful ways. \n\nI grew up in India and moved to the US for
					my undergraduate studies. The time that I have spent in both places
					has allowed me to develop and embrace a unique sense of identity. My
					values, principles, ethics, dreams are an amalgamation of both these
					beautiful cultures. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy learning new things,
					traveling, eating and cooking new foods, watching movies, taking
					nature walks and spending time with the kids in my life. My other
					interests include understanding the nature of consciousness, Buddhism,
					spirituality and philosophy.
				</p>
				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>
					I have been in the field of psychology for over a decade both in
					clinical and research capacities. I completed my APA-accredited
					pre-doctoral internship at the Rutgers University Behavioral Health
					Care. I have a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Montclair State
					University, NJ. I also hold a Master{"â€™"}s Degree in Psychology in
					Education from Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nSince I began
					my journey in the field of psychology over ten years ago, I have had
					the opportunity to work in diverse settings ranging from partial care
					programs, hospitals to private practices. Each experience allowed me
					to develop a distinct skillset and an innate drive to continue to
					learn and better myself as a clinician and research scientist.
				</p>
				<h2>Treatment Philosophy</h2>
				<p>
					My goal in therapy is to help provide the best possible psychological
					care for my patients by using a holistic and person-centered approach
					that involves understanding the human behind the illness.\n\nI have
					extensive experience using a variety of Evidence-Based Treatments
					(EBTs), such as, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Behavior Therapy
					(BT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment
					Therapy (ACT), and have used these approaches to help individuals of
					all ages with complex psychological presentations including mood
					disorders, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, personality
					disorders, chronic pain and substance use problems.\n\nBeing an
					immigrant woman of color, I am particularly interested in working with
					individuals from marginalized communities and those with
					intersectional identities. I hope that through our work together, you
					are able to have a better quality of life and come closer to embodying
					your best and most authentic self.
