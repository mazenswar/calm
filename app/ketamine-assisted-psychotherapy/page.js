					<h2>What is Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy?</h2>
					<p>
						KAP combines low-dose ketamine with structured psychotherapy to
						support emotional healing and inner transformation. Research shows
						it may help people with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and
						OCDâ€”especially when traditional therapy hasn{"'"}t been enough.
					</p>
					<p>The medicine opens a window. Therapy helps you walk through it.</p>
