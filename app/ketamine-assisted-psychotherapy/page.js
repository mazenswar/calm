					<h2>What is Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy?</h2>
					<p>
						KAP combines low-dose ketamine with structured psychotherapy to
						support emotional healing and inner transformation. Research shows
						it may help people with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD,
						especially when other approaches haven{"'"}t led to lasting change.
					</p>
					<p>The medicine opens a window. Therapy helps you walk through it.</p>

					<h2>How It Works</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Foundational Therapy Sessions</strong>
							<p>
								Before beginning ketamine work, clients complete at least six
								foundational sessions to build trust, explore intentions, and
								prepare emotionally and practically for dosing.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Medical Screening</strong>
							<p>
								We partner with Journey Clinical to conduct a medical
								evaluation. If approved, they prescribe ketamine lozenges and
								handle all medical follow-ups.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Dosing Sessions</strong>
							<p>
								Held virtually with your therapist present via secure video. A
								support person must be home during the session. Most clients
								complete eight dosing sessions.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Integration Sessions</strong>
							<p>
								We meet after each dose (typically within 24â€“72 hours) to
								process insights, support meaning-making, and apply the
								experience to your healing work.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Ongoing Support</strong>
							<p>
								After the initial series, clients may return for booster
								sessions every 6-8 weeks and continue therapy as needed to
								support long-term integration.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
