  "content:encoded": "<p>There is a lot to be anxious about right now. Many people are wondering how to manage anxiety while living through times marked by political unrest, economic instability, and a constant threat of societal destabilization. People are dying, communities are grieving, and many of us feel powerless in the face of global suffering. If you have been feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or even hopeless, it makes sense.</p><p>While we cannot control much of what is happening in the world, there are practical things you can do to manage anxiety and care for yourself.</p><p><strong>1. Focus on what you can control</strong></p><p>Anxiety often feeds on uncertainty and powerlessness. Research shows that our attention naturally gravitates toward potential threats, which can make danger feel even closer than it is (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Wise et al., 2019). One helpful step is to shift your focus to what is within your control. This does not mean ignoring the suffering around you. It means doing what you can with the energy and resources you have.</p><p>Some practical examples:</p><ul><li>Make a donation to a cause you believe in.</li><li>Help a neighbor or offer support to someone in your community.</li><li>Organize a local event or mutual aid effort.</li><li>Focus on doing your work with care, purpose, and integrity.</li><li>Show up in the world with kindness, patience, and courage.</li></ul><p>Taking meaningful action, no matter how small, can bring a sense of direction when the world feels overwhelming.</p><p><strong>2. Set clear boundaries with news and social media to manage anxiety</strong></p><p>It is easy to feel like you need to stay constantly updated, but excessive exposure to distressing news can amplify anxiety. Studies have found that continual news consumption is linked to higher stress levels and poorer physical and mental health (McLaughlin et al., 2023; Thompson et al., 2022). Consider limiting how often you check the news and curating your social media feeds.</p><p>Some practical tips:</p><ul><li>Disable push notifications for news apps.</li><li>Designate specific times in the day to check the news, rather than scrolling throughout the day.</li><li>Follow reliable sources and unfollow accounts that repeatedly increase your distress without adding meaningful value.</li><li>Use social media settings to minimize exposure to unsolicited news, such as muting certain keywords or customizing feeds where possible.</li></ul><p>There is a delicate balance between staying informed and protecting your mental health. You can care deeply and remain engaged without immersing yourself in distressing updates all day.</p><p><strong>3. Let go of convincing others</strong></p><p>It can feel like a personal mission to change the minds of people who think differently from us, especially in polarized times. But some people hold firmly to their beliefs, and spending energy trying to convince them can leave you feeling exhausted.</p><p>I remember a time when I realized someone close to me held political views that felt deeply unsafe to me. In an effort to understand, I intentionally followed news sources and commentators I would typically avoid. What I found was that their reality was constantly validated by what they consumed, just as mine was. We were living in parallel but very different worlds. That experience helped me release the exhausting need to convince others. I focused instead on how I wanted to live with purpose and integrity in my own life and work. Sometimes doing your part with care is enough.</p><p><strong>4. Connect and contribute where you can</strong></p><p>When the world feels overwhelming, it can help to turn toward your immediate circles and communities. Reach out to people you trust. Contribute where you can, in ways that are sustainable for you. Even small acts of kindness can be grounding and offer a sense of belonging.</p><p>Caring for others and being part of a community has been shown to reduce feelings of helplessness and improve resilience (Bjørlykhaug et al., 2021; Southwick et al., 2016; Trzeciak &amp; Mazzarelli, 2022). We are not meant to carry the burden of the world alone. Participating in collective care and leaning on each other is part of what helps us keep going.</p><p><strong>5. Practice mind-body strategies in the moment</strong></p><p>When anxiety feels overwhelming in the body, it can be helpful to engage in simple, soothing practices that reconnect you to the present. Slow, intentional breathing can help calm your system. You can also try grounding exercises, such as noticing five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste.</p><p>Gentle activities that bring you into your body can also help settle your system. Walking barefoot in the grass, spending time in nature, tending to a garden, or doing something with your hands can offer stability and relief.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IRTE5i1HrMwMFMgaKFVjaA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Simple, tactile practices can ground you and offer stability when anxiety feels overwhelming.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>6. Give yourself permission to feel</strong></p><p>It is okay to feel anxious. You do not need to rush to fix it or make it disappear. Sometimes the most caring thing you can do is simply allow yourself to feel the weight of the moment without turning away from it. Sitting with your feelings, even briefly, can be a powerful way of honoring your own humanity.</p><p><strong>7. Rest When You Need To, to Sustain Activism and Prevent Burnout</strong></p><p>You do not have to constantly be working to create change. Whether it is through talking to others, posting online, or engaging in whatever form of activism feels meaningful to you, it is okay to take a break. There are many others who also care deeply and who are in this alongside you. When you need to step back, others will continue the work.</p><p>When you notice that you are feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, or struggling to keep going, that is a signal to rest. Taking a break does not mean you are giving up. It means you are protecting your ability to return when you are ready, and it is an essential part of sustainable care and engagement.</p><p><strong>A Closing Reflection</strong></p><p>It is completely understandable to feel anxious right now. Whether you are coping with anxiety triggered by global unrest, social media, or economic uncertainty, you are not alone in this. There is no perfect way to navigate these times, but you can take care of yourself, and these are some ways to begin.</p><p>For those who find it helpful, it may also bring comfort to remember that we are part of something larger, something that may not always be visible or fully understood. The world has always held both unspeakable suffering and quiet beauty. You are not expected to carry it all. Your part is to show up where you can, to care where you can, to do what feels right in the life you are living, and to trust that your efforts matter.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bar-Haim, Y., Lamy, D., Pergamin, L., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M.
