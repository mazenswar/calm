As therapists, we hold space for people with diverse worldviews, values, and beliefs — many of which may differ from our own. But what happens when a client’s values or opinions stand in direct opposition to ours, especially on deeply divisive moral issues?\nIn recent years, moral and political issues — such as party affiliations, social justice, or global conflicts — have polarized people in ways that feel personal and deeply uncomfortable. For therapists, the challenge lies in maintaining professionalism and empathy while also navigating our own emotional and moral boundaries.\nWhen Differing Views Build Connection\nOne of the most surprising aspects of my work has been the ways in which connection can flourish across moral divides.

There are moments when I feel the weight of my own values and beliefs in the room. Therapy demands that we hold space for our clients, but it also asks us to be honest with ourselves.
